# Isolates in Flutter
Definition:
Isolates are Flutter's solution for achieving concurrency. An isolate is an independent worker that has its own memory heap and does not share memory with other isolates. This eliminates the risks of race conditions and deadlocks.

Characteristics:

Each isolate has its own memory and event loop.
Isolates communicate with each other via message passing, not shared memory.
Suitable for running parallel tasks without affecting the main thread.
